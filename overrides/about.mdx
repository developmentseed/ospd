    The VEDA Dashboard is one of several user interfaces in the VEDA project. The VEDA project is an open-source platform sponsored by NASA IMPACT, originally built for scientists and researchers to access and analyze earth observation data, and then share the results of their work with the broader community. This instance of the VEDA Dashboard was built for the Open Source Persistent Demonstrator (OSPD) to showcase VEDAâ€™s interoperability within the larger open science community. 

    ## Commitment to Open Science

    In alignment with NASA's [Transform to Open Science](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science) (TOPS) initiative, VEDA believes that a commitment to open source is an important aspect of creating and maintaining high-quality software and science. Open source code provided by VEDA as part of this initiative allows for collaboration and transparency, to promote better solutions and more robust code.

    The different repositories of the VEDA project are all open and can be freely browsed:
    - [veda-ui](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui) (the web application)
    - [veda-config](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-config) (content storage)
    - [veda-data-pipelines](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-data-pipelines) (data transformation and ingest)
    - [veda-backend](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-backend) (backend stac and tiler)
    
    The full list can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/NASA-IMPACT/repositories?language=&q=veda-&sort=&type=all).
    
    Furthermore this project would not be possible without many other openly maintained projects like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [MapboxGl](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js), [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel), [STAC](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec), and [TiTiler](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler) to name a few.
